# Abstract or executive summary

At a broad level, this project examines the minimum wage as a solution to income inequality—and one potential limitation to this approach. In 2014, Seattle was the first major city to pass a $15 minimum wage. Policymakers hoped that higher wages for low-paid workers would reduce inequality and poverty and make Seattle workers and their families better off. However, the phase in of Seattle’s $15 wage coincided with another economic jolt—the rapid influx of tens of thousands of high-paid technology workers. These new arrivals needed housing. Rental prices climbed rapidly, and large swaths of the city quickly gentrified. As a result, low-wage workers were likely priced out of Seattle housing just as the raise to $15 took effect. While economists argue over the extent to which increasing minimum wages lowers *demand* for low-paid workers, Seattle’s hot housing market might have also affected the *supply* of people looking for low-paid jobs. Understanding these dynamics has important implications for how policy-makers approach minimum wage increases. This project will probe the hypothesis that the supply of low-wage labor dropped in Seattle over the years 2014-2016.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71749250/124018733-001e2300-d99d-11eb-8873-7965efdab71f.png)
