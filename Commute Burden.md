title: Commute Burden 
---

**Context**
One possible way of assessing an individual's spatial mismatch, is by tracking their commuting changes over time. Particularly, estimating their distance traveled and time spent commuting can determine if their commute burden is improving and or worsening. To do this, we can utilize the geocoded data from WMLAD that contains a persons residential and work address. However, even though the WMLAD archivists have gone to great lengths to de-identify indivuals, a person can still be identified using home and work locations along with other spatial indicators. For this reason, we have decided to further de-identify the individuals by analyzing commute variables at the census tract level. That is, a person's home and work location will only be tied to some arbitrary census tract midpoint. This is demonstrated in the figure below that exemplifies King County census tract, their associated midpoints, and example commutes from home tract midpoint to work tract midpoints.
