title: Housing Burden
---
**Context**

The WMLAD data does not include data regarding how much money workers are spending on rent each month. However, in examining the effects of the $15 minimum wage ordiance, housing costs are of particular importance. Thus, we utilized publicly available data from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Small Area Fair Market rental prices for select zipcodes in the Puget Sound Region to estimate workers that are likely to be rent burdened. We defined rent burden as paying 30% or more of earnings on rent. We found that in 2011, when the state minium wage was $8.67/hr that nearly 100% of low wage workers in the Puget Sound region were likely rent burdened. This is in contrast to 2016, when the state minimum wage was $9.47/hr wherein there was a reduction in the proportion of low wage workers who were rent burdened in the Seattle area and an apparent increase in rent burdened low-wage workers in the outer most zipcodes. One explanation for this is that increases in the minimum wage was helping low wage workers to pay rent. Alternatively, low wage workers were moving out of the city during this time, and were priced out of the housing market.
