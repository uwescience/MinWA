**Research Question**

This project uses unique longitudinal data from 2010-2017 to examine the effects of Seattle’s 2015 $15 minimum wage ordinance on workers earning low wages in the Puget Sound while accounting for the impact of residential displacement. The following question guides this research: 

To what extent did the minimum wage ordinance affect residential displacement, the demographic distribution of workers, housing price burden, and work commute burden in the Puget Sound region from 2010-2017?

We are additionally interested in leveraging this unique data to understand and operationalize laborer well-being.

**Background**

Why is this important?

In 2014, Seattle was the first major city to pass a \$15 minimum wage. Policymakers hoped that higher wages for low-paid workers would reduce inequality and poverty and make Seattle workers and their families better off. However, the phase-in of Seattle’s $15 wage coincided with another economic jolt—the rapid influx of tens of thousands of high-paid technology workers. 

Increased housing prices and development, particularly of high-end housing, exacerbated by these new tech workers, have led to further gentrification. As a result, low-wage workers are being priced out of Seattle housing just as the raise to $15 took effect.
