**Questions**

This project will probe the hypothesis that the supply of low-wage labor dropped in Seattle over the years 2014-2016. Our DSSG team will track residential relocation (moves) relative to places of employment (jobs) in the Puget Sound. Questions include: 

1. Did lower earners move out of Seattle faster than higher earners? 
2. How many workers earning at or near the minimum wage in 2014 moved out of the city over the subsequent years? 
3. Was that rate of relocation faster than for earlier cohorts of low-paid workers? 
4. How did low-wage workers’ commutes change? 
5. For each low-paid position in the city, how many workers of similar wage rates live within reasonable commuting radii?
